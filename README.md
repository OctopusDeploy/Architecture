# Architecture

You can use this repository to record decisions and guidance about the architecture of the [Octopus Deploy](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy) product:

1. If you're just documenting how something currently works, you can raise a PR with a new markdown file. For example, if you want to document something about how we deal with database migrations, you could raise a PR with a new file called `/OctopusServer/Migrations.md`.

2. If you're proposing something new, or want to record a decision made at a particular point in time, you can raise a PR with a new [Architecture Decision Record](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Architecture/tree/master/Decisions).

Invite feedback via Slack channels like [#topic-architecture](https://octopusdeploy.slack.com/archives/CTZT49JFJ), and use PRs to reach consensus before merging.

## Structure

ADRs should be organized by product, then feature. Or a top level folder if it's cross-product.

Pascal casing should be used for file and folder names.
