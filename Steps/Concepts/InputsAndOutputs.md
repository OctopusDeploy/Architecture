# Inputs

To do their job, steps need to be given inputs that define all of their relevant contextual information - cloud service details, package details, Octopus environmental details, and more. These inputs are usually supplied by a user via the step's UI.

## Problem

Prior to Step Packages, Octopus provided no explicit schema definition for the inputs a given step needed defined to do its job - it used a Namespace-keyed state bag approach to supplying steps with their inputs.

The problems with this approach are:

- It is difficult to find what inputs a step expects
- It is difficult to tell what type of information each input should capture (i.e. number, string, complex type) - at the moment the only place we enforce the type of info is within validators
- Complex types can only be expressed as flat sets of keys
- Input keys are redefined in up to three places for certain steps
- It is difficult to determine what keys within the state bag a given step might care about at runtime

## Solution: Structured Inputs and Input Schemas

Steps will define structured types for their inputs. These types may reference types defined by the step itself, and types defined by Octopus Server, such as Package References and Sensitive Values.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/step-package-azurestorage/blob/main/steps/blob-storage-upload/src/inputs.ts) input type from the [Azure Storage](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/step-package-azurestorage) Step Package.

This input definition is used by the Step UI and Step Executor, and solves the problems identified above.

When the Step UI contributes a set of inputs by sending it to the Octopus Server API, it is stored in Octopus Server as a JSON document on the `DeploymentAction` domain entity.

So that Octopus Server can understand this document, a language-agnostic representation of the inputs needs to be made available - because Server does not speak TypeScript. At execution-time, Octopus Server needs to be able to identify and work with Package References, Senstive Variables, and other types that are defined and specific to Octopus Server, that might be referenced within a step's inputs.

We have chosen [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) as the format to provide this language-agnostic representation.

The [Step Package CLI](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/step-package-cli/blob/main/src/commands/SchemaGenerator.ts) is responsible for generating this schema from the `default export` of a given step's `inputs.ts` input declaration file. You can read more about the convention-based file structure used within Step Packages [here](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Architecture/blob/master/Steps/Components/StepPackages.md).

# Bounded Contexts

## Problem

Different parts of the Step Package ecosystem may have different conceptual views of the same logical step input model.

Let's use **Package Reference** as an example.

The `Step UI API` enables Step Package authors to be able to specify an input property as a `PackageReference`, but not actually give them access to any of the internal properties of this type - the internal representation is owned by Octopus Server.

To the Step UI, the `PackageReference` type looks like so:

```
export type PackageReference = { readonly __packageReferenceBrand: unique symbol };
```

Octopus Server is responsible for managing package references - it is both responsible for providing the UI framework components that capture package reference details, and is responsible for coordinating package-related features, as described in the [Execution](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Architecture/blob/master/Steps/Concepts/Execution.md) documentation.

To Octopus Server, the `PackageReference` type looks like so:

```
public class PackageReference
{
  ...
  public string Id { get; }

  public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

  public string PackageId { get; set; } = string.Empty;

  public FeedIdOrName FeedIdOrName { get; set; }

  public string AcquisitionLocation { get; set; } = string.Empty;

  ...
}
```

Finally, at execution time, our Step Executor is interested in package information, but in a different shape. It is less concerned about the feed Id of a package, or its name, and is more interested in details like _where was it extracted?_

To the Step Executor, the `PackageReference` type looks like so:

```
export type PackageReference = {
    extractedToPath: string;
};
```

Each of these views is a _Bounded Context_ - it is an interpretation of a given logical model (Package References) that is relevant to a specific context - UI, Server, and Executor.

## Solution: Type and Data Mapping

In the above example, `PackageReference` is a type whose canonical representation is owned by Octopus Server.

For the Step UI, we use a Branded Type to represent our package reference.

The Branded Type is a specific typescript type whose contents cannot be set, but the type itself can be declared:

```
export type PackageReference = { readonly __packageReferenceBrand: unique symbol };
```

This allows step authors to designate which properties on their structured input model are package references, but to not be exposed or coupled to Server's representation of the canonical package reference type. The [Step UI Framework](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Architecture/blob/master/Steps/Components/StepUI.md), which lives in server, instead takes on the responsibility for rendering package selectors, and capturing the necessary information for package activities at execution time.

For the Step Executor, we use a Mapped Type, and a corresponding Input Processor.

[Mapped Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html) are a typescript capability that allow us to emit a type that is based on another type. In this case, we can create a type mapping that takes the UI representation of a PackageReference, and substitute it for an Execution representation of it:

```
export type RuntimePackageReference = {
    extractedToPath: string;
};

export type ExecutionInputs<Properties> = {
    [Property in keyof Properties]:
        Properties[Property] extends PackageReference ? RuntimePackageReference :
            // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-types
            Properties[Property] extends object ? ExecutionInputs<Properties[Property]> : Properties[Property];
};
```

Within the Server Execution Pipeline, Server then maps the information declared by this type to the input document via a set of [Input Processors](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy/blob/master/source/Octopus.Server/Orchestration/ServerTasks/Deploy/StepPackages/StepPackageInputProcessor.cs) - these processors are data mapping functions that use the step input schema to identify any package references (or other types of interest) on it, and map the information it has on-hand about them to the step inputs them being supplied to the Step Executor.

When the step input document arrives at the Step Executor, its `PackageReference` properties have had their execution-time bounded-context-specific information mapped to them.

> The fundamental idea underpinning the above is that the Step UI owns the canonical model for a step's inputs, and sometimes it will compose into that model other types whose canonical model is owned by Server (PackageReference in our example). When a canonical model needs to be used in another bounded context, we will employ a mixture of Type (Branded Types, Mapped Types) and Data Mapping to transform canonical types and their data into bounded-context specific projections.

# Bound Variables

## Problem

The Step Inputs collection contains various properties that can be configured. These properties are often primitive values like strings or booleans.

Users can bind any of these values to variables, such that the value of these properties can either by their underlying primitive value type (string, boolean, etc), or a bound value.

## Constraints

The following constraints will apply to steps

- Variable binding should be disabled for properties that branches the form or control flow of the step.
  - If these properties could be bound, it would be difficult to
    - reason about what the step UI should look like when it was bound
    - use Union types to represent valid states of properties
  - Customers that want to vary this property can duplicate the step with each configuration they want.
- Every field in the UI has a single explicit property in the inputs object to which it corresponds.
  - There are no cases where multiple UI controls map to a single input property
  - There are no cases where multiple input properties map to a single UI control
- Both our step UI and our step functions should have input properties that are structured similarly
  - The exact types of some of the primitives may vary, but structurally they should be identical (e.g. the same nested objects, arrays, union types)
- Both our Step UI and our step functions should be able to use union types
  - This allows us to build an intuitive, nested, and idiomatic input object structure
- Discriminators should always be explicit properties in our inputs object, rather than implied by the presence or absence of other properties
  - This makes the structure of the input objects more consistent between steps
  - This constraint can drastically simplify the way we develop our Step UIs
- UI components that show or hide based on discriminators should always be shown immediately next to the discriminator selection
  - This could be a section immediately afterwards, or the controls could be inline with the discriminator UI control
- Only supported primitive values can be bound. Objects and lists cannot be bound.
  - Predictable type narrowing and the use of union types is much more difficult without this constraint.

## Design

### Guiding principle

**Remove knowledge of bound variables from our Step API where it would otherwise cause excessive boilerplate, repetition or be a source of inconsistencies.**

#### Why?

It would be nice if our Steps could be completely unaware of bound variables. This would allow Octopus Server to completely own and control this concept, and keep our steps as lean as possible. However, this is not feasible because there are some step-specific functions that need to take bound variables into account.

The next best thing we can do is remove knowledge of bound variables from the places where we would otherwise find ourselves repeating the same patterns and boilerplate in all of our steps. If all of our steps had to implement these same patterns, they would not be as simple as they could be, and there is a greater opportunity for mistakes if we don't follow these patterns consistently.

### Our Step API should be unaware of bound variables when

- Showing, hiding or displaying dynamic content in the UI
- Declaring validation rules
- Receiving inputs into a step function
- Binding UI controls to input properties
- Declaring the input schema (i.e. we should not need to declare which properties support variable binding)

### Our step API will need to be aware of bound variables when

- Serializing to and from an exported representation of the step (e.g. YAML for K8s steps)
- Writing expressive human-readable section summaries that may need to take the context of variable binding into account
