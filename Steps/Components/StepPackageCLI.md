# Step Pacakge CLI

## Overview

The **Step Package CLI** is a nodejs cli tool which is used within Step Packages to ensure they are built and packaged in a way that is compatible with Octopus Server.

By centralizing the detail of how Step Packages are built into a single tool, we avoid this detail spreading across CI scripts and propogating throughout Step Package repositories.
